# Overview

The goal of this vignette is to illustrate the process behind the `rnp_otms_data` (**r**ead a**n**d **p**rocess OTMs data) and `gen_otm_splines` (**gen**erate **OTM** **spline** model**s**) functions of the `throne` package. The first function allows the user to read one or multiple raw `.csv` (see ["Collecting OTM data vignette"](https://ggcostoya.github.io/throne/articles/collect_otm_data.html)) with temperature measurements recorded by a temperature logger inside of an **operative temperature model** (**OTM**) to a data frame in `R`. The second function takes this processed OTM data and generates an OTM & day of year (`doy`) specific cubic spline model that describes the thermal dynamics of each unique OTM each day. These spline models will later be used to both [correct the flights data](https://ggcostoya.github.io/throne/articles/correct_flights_data.html) and to ultimately [predict thermal landscapes](https://ggcostoya.github.io/throne/articles/predict_thermal_landscapes.html). Below, we highlight the section of the package's workflow that is covered in this vignette:

```{r show part of workflow image, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center'}

```

Next, we will discuss each function in detail.

# Reading and processing OTM data

The `rnp_otms_data` function reads a database of `.csv` files, manipulates and ultimately combines them into a large `data.frame` in `R`. Below we detail the function's inputs, processes and output

## Inputs

The `rnp_otms_data` function takes the following inputs:

1. **`path`**, the directory where one or multiple `.csv` files are stored. Each of these `.csv` files is assumed to have at least:

  a) A column for operative temperature measurements. Since different temperature logger processing software      structure the outputs differently in the resulting `.csv` file, `throne` requires the user to specify the column where the OTM measurements can be found in the `op_temp_col` argument of the function. We used [OneWire   Viewer](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/1-wire-sdks/viewer.html) which returns the operative temperature in the `3`rd column.

  b) A column for dates. As with the operative temperature values, `throne` also requires the user to specify the `date_col` in their `.csv` files. OneWireViewer returns the date in the first column in `MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS AM/PM` format. By default dates and times will be extracted from this column but other software return date and time in separate columns. If that is the case, the user can specify the `time_col` as an argument of the function.
  
> **TIP**: Users of `throne` should become very familiar with the formatting of the `.csv` files containing OTM data. In some software options, the resulting `.csv` file will contain several rows of metadata that might lead to an incorrect reading of the file (see example below). While the `rnp_otms_data` will provide warnings we also recommend the users to specify how many rows should be skipped when reading each file file via the `rows_skip` argument. Specifying the `rows_skip` argument correctly is crucial for the rest of the package's functions to work properly down the line. For more information, see the function's documentation [here](https://ggcostoya.github.io/throne/reference/rnp_otms_data.html)

2.  An OTM **`metadata`** `data.frame` or `tibble` containing information related to each specific OTM (identified by a unique `otm_id`). The user can include any metadata for the OTM but we require that an `otm_id` column is present and we strongly recommend that the metadata also contains columns for the `latitude` and `longitude` at which the OTM was deployed. In the example metadata shipped with `throne` we also incorporate information on the `microhabitat`, `orientation` and `elevation` at which the OTM was deployed.

```{r show head of otms_metadata}
head(otms_metadata)
```

## Processes 

To transform the raw `.csv` data into a `data.frame` the `rnp_otm_data` function will go through the following general steps:

1.  Read each `.csv` file while skipping as many rows as specified within the `rows_skip` argument.
2.  Select the columns for time and operative temperature as specified by the `date_col` (and/or `time_col`) and `op_temp_col` arguments.
3. Re-project `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates to `x` and `y` UTM coordinates to enable compatibility with the rest of the package's functionality using tools from the [`terra` package](https://rspatial.org/pkg/)
3.  Using tools from the `lubridate` package, extract the `year`, day of the year (`doy)` and minute of the day (`mod`) at which each operative temperature measurement (`op_temp`) was made.

> **NOTE**: Working `doy` and `mod` allows the user to work with numeric colums. This simplifies the management of the data, as dates and times have unique data formats in the `R` environment that are often difficult to handle and may lead unintended errors. Nonetheless, these formats can be  transformed back into more  interpretable temporal scales for visualization purposes, [by using the `as.Date` function to transform `doy` (also known as Julian date) back into a YYYY-MM-DD format](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24200014/convert-day-of-year-to-date) and dividing by 60 for `mod` to get hours.

4.  Merge the processed data for each OTM with its corresponding metadata and, if more than one file is specified, bind the outputs together.

## Output

The final output is a `data.frame` like this:

```{r show head of otms_data}
head(otms_data)
```

Each row will corresponds to a unique operative temperature (`op_temp`) measurement by a given `otm_id` in a given `year`, `doy` and `mod`. Our example data set contains measurements of 33 OTMs over 4 days recording at a rate of 720 observations / day (30 observations / h, 0.5 observations / min).

# Generating OTM cubic spline models

The next step in the `throne` workflow will be to fit a **cubic smoothing spline model** to each OTM each `doy` during it's deployment in the field. This model will capture the thermal dynamics of the OTM in a given `doy` enabling a temporally continuous prediction of operative temperature from discrete measurements. To achieve this, `throne` includes the `gen_otm_splines` function, which takes as input the output generated via `rnp_otms_data`. The function will then calculate OTM and `doy` specific splines and return a nested `tibble` with an OTM identifier column, associated metadata, together with a [nested column](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) containing the  model generated via the native `R` function `smooth.spline`. Below we show how to use the `gen_otm_splines` function:

```{r show how to calculate OTM splines, eval = FALSE}
otm_splines_ex <- gen_otm_splines(otm_data = otms_data, knot_p = 0.02) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c("microhabitat", "orientation", "elevation"))
```

```{r calculate OTM splines silently, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
otm_splines_ex <- gen_otm_splines(otm_data = otms_data, knot_p = 0.02) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c("microhabitat", "orientation", "elevation"))
```

```{r show OTM splines object}
otm_splines_ex
```

>**Why splines?**: Using a smoothing function as opposed to modelling OTM thermal fluctuations using biophysical principles offers, in this case, a more flexible approach. Smoothing minimizes noise from short-term, stochastic shifts in operative temperature while capturing fluctuations caused by conditions unique to each day (e.g., sustained changes in cloud cover or wind) that may be ecologically relevant. This approach eliminates the need to collect additional metadata during OTM deployment (e.g., aspect or shade cover) and removes the assumption that within-day thermal fluctuations follow a fixed sinusoidal curve in order to inform the resulting models. Nonetheless, as the level of smoothing may be important in certain systems and may influence the ability of `throne` to match OTMs with orthomosaic tiles, the `gen_otm_splines` function incorporates the parameter `knot_p` which allows users to determine their desired level of smoothness 

# Choosing the appropriate `knot_p` value

A critical point for the `gen_otm_splines` function to work correctly is determining the appropriate value for the `knot_p` argument. This argument determines the percentage of observations recorded by an OTM in a given day that are used to determine the number of knots of the smoothing spline model. The number of knots will ultimately determine the degrees of freedom of the model as $df = degree + k$ and $degree = 3$ for cubic splines (see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/517375/splines-relationship-of-knots-degree-and-degrees-of-freedom#:~:text=In%20essence%2C%20splines%20are%20piecewise,degree%203%20and%20so%20on.) for further details). The number of degrees of freedom will then determine the "wiggliness" of the resulting model, i.e. the number of times the resulting curve will change direction. As an example, below we plot different spline models for the same data using different `knot_p` parameter values.

```{r calculating splines with different knot_p, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, include = FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}

# filter specific OTM data even further
otm_data_id <- otm_data_id |> dplyr::filter(otm_id == "OTM01")
```

```{r plot splines with different knot_p combinations, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
# plot
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = otm_data_id,
             aes(x = mod/60, y = op_temp), 
             size = 3, alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_line(data = otm_pred, 
            aes(x = mod/60, y = op_temp, col = as.factor(round(knot_p, digits = 3))),
            alpha = 0.75, linewidth = 1.25) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +

  ylab("Operative Temperature (°C)") +

    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14)
        ) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "knot_p")) +
  ggtitle("OTM01 on DOY 237 (August 25th)")
```

The first factor to consider is the **frequency at which the OTM itself is recording**. We can extrapolate how many knots/day (or knots/h) we would get based on the frequency of recordings and the `knot_p` value according to the formula:

$$ Knot/h = Recordings/h \cdot knot_p$$ 

For instance, the OTMs we use as an example in this package were programmed to record a temperature measurement every 2 minutes, leading to a total of 30 observations / hour. Assuming a `knot_p = 0.1` that would indicate that our model has 3 knots / h. We recommend setting `knot_p` to a higher value if the frequency of observations is low, but the decision ultimately comes to the user of the methodology. Feel free to reach out to the package maintainer for recommendations. 

The second issue that determines the value of `knot_p` is the study organism. Generally, OTMs will equilibrate to the environmental temperature much faster than the organism they represent with this difference in equilibration time being positively correlated to the mass of the organism due to thermal inertia. We recommend understanding the thermal properties of the organism of interest when choosing the appropriate `knot_p` value as we did in our pilot study.

Having shown how to read and process both flights and OTM data the next step will be to correct the flights data to transform surface temperature to operative temperature temperature measurements.
