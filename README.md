# `throne`: predicting thermal landscapes in spatio-temporally unprecedented detail.

Accurately quantifying and mapping thermal environments is crucial to
predict how environmental change is impacting organisms across
ecosystems. There are two major obstacles in accurately describing
thermal landscapes: (1) overcoming the mismatch between the scale at
which a particular organism experiences thermal variation and the
resolution at which environmental data are typically collected, and 2)
projecting future thermal landscapes from contemporary ones without
substantial measurement gaps in time or space. Here, we present a new
method that integrates IR drone photogrammetry with field-deployed OTMs
to generate fine-scale, spatiotemporally complete landscapes (maps) of
operative temperature. We developed the R package throne which
streamlines all necessary corrections to raw drone data and produces
operative thermal landscapes with minimal raw data input required by the
user. By generating biologically relevant thermal maps at high
spatiotemporal resolution, this should enhance the accuracy and
accessibility of detailed and biologically relevant thermal landscapes
for species around the globe and improve our ability to forecast the
responses of organisms to environmental change.
