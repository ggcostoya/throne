# `throne`: Using aerial thermography to map terrestrial thermal environments in unprecedented detail <img src="man/figures/throne_hex_logo.png" width="200" align="right" />

Accurately quantifying and mapping thermal environments is crucial to predict 
how environmental change is going to impact organisms. However, describing thermal
environments is challenging because 1) there is a mismatch between the resolution
of available data and the scale at which organisms experience thermal variation, and 
2) available tools can pose a challenge for inexperienced users. Here, we present
the `throne` package, which provides tools to combine spatially discrete but temporally
complete measurements from temperature loggers with spatially complete but temporally 
discrete thermal maps obtained via IR drone photogrammetry to produce spatio-temporally
complete thermal landscapes. 

## Getting started

The package is currently under development and not yet available on CRAN, but it 
can be dowloaded directly from GitHub via:

```R
 devtools::install_github("ggcostoya/throne")
```

For an overview of how the `throne` works please visit [this page](https://ggcostoya.github.io/throne/articles/overview.html)

## How to cite the package

This package accompanies a manuscript that is currently under review in Methods in
Ecology & Evolution. 

If you use `throne` in your research, please cite the package as:
