<p>The goal of this vignette is to illustrate the first step of the
workflow presented in the <code>throne</code> package which is the
acquisition of thermal photogrammetry data. To do this, we will need to
1) acquire a drone with a mounted IR thermal imaging camera, 2) fly the
drone to collect thermal images, and 3) process the thermal images using
a photogrammetry software to obtain a thermal orthomosaic of a flight
(i.e., a <code>.tif</code> format file). Here we provide instructions on
how to perform each of these steps and we include links to recommended
drones, software and tutorials to complement them.</p>

</h2>
<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), colloquially known as “drones”, are
rapidly becoming cheaper and more accessible to use. Drones come in all
shapes and sizes, from first-person view (FPV) miniature racing
quadcopters, to large payload-carrying hexcopters. Hobbyists can
purchase and fly smaller drones for recreational purposes for less than
$500 (such as the [DJI Mini SE 2] (<a href="https://www.dji.com/mini-2-se" class="external-link uri">https://www.dji.com/mini-2-se</a>)), while a drone that is
used for commercial (or research) purposes may require higher
specifications (extending up to $5000+). For example, more expensive
drones typically come with more accurate on-board geolocation systems
(GNSS or RTK modules), better in-flight stabilization systems for
accurate photography, batteries with higher capacity, obstacle detection
sensors, and stronger protection against the elements (rain, heat, dust
etc.). More importantly, higher-quality drones are designed to reliably
carry expensive camera equipment, such as high-resolution visual (RGB)
cameras for topography models, near-infrared cameras for mapping
vegetation, or infrared cameras (such as FLIR cameras, developed by
Teledyne Systems) to build thermal landscape models.</p>
<p>When choosing a drone equipped with an infrared camera (“thermal
drone”), it is important to note that the camera is typically paired
with a particular drone model. Different drones have different gimbal
(camera) mounting systems, which means that the cameras themselves are
rarely interchangeable. It is also important to note that the paired
thermal cameras are typically as expensive - if not more expensive - as
the drone itself. The price of the thermal camera is typically
determined by its accuracy and resolution (rarely exceeding 640x512
pixels - considerably lower than RGB cameras). Purchasing a thermal
drone should therefore be considered an investment that should last for
many years for anyone interested in conducting high-resolution thermal
research.</p>
<p>Currently, DJI Enterprises dominates the market with many drone
options capable of being equipped with thermal cameras. The <a href="https://enterprise.dji.com/mavic-3-enterprise" class="external-link">DJI Mavic 3T</a> is
the thermal variant of the commonly used DJI Mavic 3 drone, and costs
approximately $5,000. In the higher end of the spectrum, for
approximately $9,000, DJI also sells the [Matrice 30T] (<a href="https://enterprise.dji.com/matrice-30" class="external-link uri">https://enterprise.dji.com/matrice-30</a>) which is much
more rugged, boasts a more accurate on-board positioning system, is
equipped with higher-resolution cameras, and overall designed to chart
larger, more remote areas. Finally, there is a fairly large market of
used drones, that can be an option if budget is a concern. A used <a href="https://www.dji.com/matrice-200-series-v2" class="external-link">DJI Matrice 200
v2</a>(the model we use, equipped with a <a href="https://www.dji.com/support/product/zenmuse-xt2" class="external-link">Zenmuse XT2
camera</a>), can in 2024 be purchased for approximately $2,000. Overall,
how often we intend to use the drone, and the environmental conditions
of our field site are key factors to consider when choosing what to buy.
The specifications required to accurately survey our study site will
largely depend on the spatial scale of which we wish to predict the
thermal landscape.</p>

</h3>
<p>Once you have acquired a drone with a thermal camera, the next step
is to fly the drone to collect thermal images.Commonly, all thermal
imaging drones will come with a mission (i.e., flight plan) setting
software. In our case, we used <a href="https://www.dji.com/downloads/djiapp/dji-pilot" class="external-link">DJI Pilot</a>XX
which comes our drone model, and with an online detailed training course
tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQMMtJkQxywvYliYTEjdrgv8NTrXARiAblink" class="external-link">how
to set up flights online</a>. Since each software will be different, we
won’t provide a tutorial for each but rather we will give some general
guidelines on how to conduct missions such that they work as optimally
as possible with the software developed for <code>throne</code>.
Naturally, flight mission details will depend on the UAV’s and camera
setup, but generally speaking, standard mission planning etiquette
applies to collecting data for use within <code>throne</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Abide by all local laws and regulations regarding flight
altitude, airspace restrictions and drone registration requirements.
Check with local authorities what applies in the area of study. For
example, if flying in U.S. airspace, adhere to the <strong>Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 107</strong>, and make the flights take
place in Class G airspace, unless given explicit permission to fly
elsewhere. If used for research purposes, the drone might also need to
be registered for commercial use.</p></li>
<li><p>The default drone flight path (“zig-zag line”) is generally fine
for most purposes. We recommend avoid long, narrow flight paths to
minimize banding issues (differences between long “strips” of photos),
and that users aim to keep flight times as short as possible to make
sure that all images are collected within a relatively short span and
thus can capture the same thermal conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Fly under weather conditions that are typical to the study system
of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>We recommend distributing flights across different days and
across different times of the day, to maximize representation of daily
fluctuations in temperature</p></li>
<li><p>To avoid stitching issues, we recommend flying over a larger area
than your area of interest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An important aspect to consider when planning a flight mission is
also the resolution of the mounted thermal imaging camera. Usually,
thermal imaging cameras have a much lower resolution and field of view
than visual cameras (RGB). Therefore, make sure that the vertical and
horizontal photo overlap ratio is set high (preferably 90%/90% in either
direction, i.e., any given photo’s coverage only differs by 10% compared
to the previous), as well as maintain a relatively high flight altitude
(300 ft / 90 m). This, of course, depends on the spatial scale of the
studied landscape and the desired resolution thereof. Regardless,we
strongly encourage to make sure that missions are built around the
<em>thermal</em> camera’s field of view rather than the visual camera -
especially if flying above rugged terrain- otherwise we risk running
into stitching issues when processing the photos, (see following
sections) It’s generally a good idea to extend the flight mission area
to exceed the study site’s boundaries by a few meters to compensate for
this difference.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/drone_setup_thermal_overlap.png" alt="Figure 1. The field of view is typically smaller for thermal cameras compared to visual cameras.

compared to visual cameras. This overlay - while not perfect - aims to

one another, to illustrate the difference in the area covered
</p>
</div>
<p>A final very important factor to consider are the potential
geolocation errors of the thermal images . While some of this can be
compensated through post-processing, deploying <strong>ground control
points (GCPs)</strong> is one of the more common methods that can be
used as a preventative measure to accurately georeference flight
missions. Ground control points are GPS-tagged landmarks that allow us
to pinpoint the exact location of our field site in relation to our
photos, in addition to properly scaling our spatial models. We recommend
deploying a minimum of three GCPs per field site that you aim to survey
- simple black-and-white square tiles that we collect the have known GPS
locations for works just fine - but it is crucial that these are
deployed <strong>before</strong> any flights so that they are visible in
photos from each mission. GCPs should ideally be placed along the
borders of your study site (to properly “frame” the extent of our
model), while simultaneously encompassing the topographical complexity
of the study site. For example, if you’re surveying a flat landscape
with a few scattered rocky outcrops, it might be a good idea to place a
few GCPs along the border of the field site; a few within on flat
ground; and finally a couple on top of the outcrops. This way, we have
multiple reference points in the landscape that minimize the risk of any
future processing issues. Keep in mind that the accuracy of the GCP
locations are only as accurate as the GPS unit used to record their
location with. For minimal geo-referencing errors, we therefore
recommend a higher-end handheld GNSS system, such as those developed by
<a href="https://geospatial.trimble.com/en/products/hardware/gnss-systems" class="external-link">Trimble</a>.
For more information on GCPs, PIX4D has a <a href="https://www.pix4d.com/blog/GCP-accuracy-drone-maps/" class="external-link">great

</h2>
<p>Having collected your thermal images across multiple flights, the
next step is to use a photogrammetry software to produce <em>thermal
orthomosaic</em> images, which will be the source of the <code>R</code>
workflow of the <code>throne</code> package. We can think of a thermal
orthomosaic image as an assembled jigsaw puzzle: Each puzzle piece is a
thermal image taken by our drone, and the processing software puts them
all together (through a process called photogrammetry), while making
sure any distortion between the images are accounted for. When we have
constructed a thermal orthomosaic, we have essentially combined all the
individual images taken by our drone into a single “snapshot” of the
thermal landscape - ready for use with ‘throne’. There are plenty of
photogrammetry software capable of producing orthomosaic images from
drone imagery, and each comes with its own set of pros and cons. We use
<a href="https://www.pix4d.com/product/pix4dmapper-photogrammetry-software/" class="external-link">PIX4Dmapper</a>,
yet this software might not be accessible for everyone. <a href="https://www.opendronemap.org/" class="external-link">OpenDroneMap</a> offers a
web-based, open-source and free solution, which we won’t cover here, yet
might be a valuable option for some users. Note also that PIX4D has a
plethora of resources available n online on how to use the software
(such as <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032118251-Video-tutorials#PIX4Dmapper" class="external-link">“how-to”
videos</a> and <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001503192" class="external-link">articles</a>),
ranging from how to load images to editing raster images which we
strongly recommend users follow. Regardless, when processing thermal
images using PIX4Dmapper, we recommend the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a project by clicking “New Project” under “File”.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the folder where you wish the project folder to be
saved. We recommend saving the project in the same folder as the flight
images, assuming the images are sorted by flight mission.</p></li>
<li><p>Select all images (RGB <strong>and</strong> thermal) from the
flight mission, and only photos that are relevant to that specific
flight.</p></li>
<li><p>When prompted, select the <em>Thermal Camera</em> default
processing template. This should be visible in the menu after adding and
loading the photos to the project. For more information, see PIX4D’s
article <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205319155-Processing-Options-Default-Templates#gsc.tab=0" class="external-link">Processing
Options Default Templates</a></p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the “Pixel Size” and the “Focal Length” values are
correctly set for your camera model: on the menu bar, click Project &gt;
Image Properties Editor… and in the section Selected Camera Model, click
Edit… For step-by-step instructions about how to modify the camera
model, refer to PIX4D’s article <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202560169" class="external-link">How to use
the Editing Camera Model Options</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before starting the processing, open “Processing Options” and
navigate to <em>Keypoints Image Scale</em> under “Initial Processing”
and set it to “Full”; navigate to “Point Cloud and Mesh” and the Point
Cloud and set the <em>Image Scale</em> to 1 (original). These settings
increase the density of keypoints and the resolution of the final
product, at the cost of processing time. (The values can be left
unchanged, but note that the quality of subsequent processing steps in
<code>R</code> will be affected). If desired, we can save this as a
custom template for future <code>throne</code> flight processes, by
clicking “Save Template”.</p></li>
<li><p>If we do not wish to use (or don’t have access to any) ground
control points, go ahead and click “Start” on the Processing bar to
begin processing your images. The thermal landscape map will be
generated during the final step, “3. DSM, Orthomosaic, and Index.”.
Processing time depends on the specifications of the PC used and the
size of the project, but usually lasts a couple of hours. WeYou can
adjust the resources (GB of RAM and CPU threads) that PIX4Dmapper will
use under “Processing options”. Note that the default is to use
<strong>all</strong> the PC’s available resources.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>If ground control points in aproject within Pix4D mapper, make sure
to import them before starting the processing. PIX4D has <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202558699-Using-GCPs-PIX4Dmapper" class="external-link">a
extensive how-to guides</a> on this topic, which applies to generating
raster images for <code>throne</code> as well. Below is some general
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In PIX4Dmapper, the easiest way to import ground control points
is by loading a .csv-file that contains the latitude, longitude and
altitude of your GCPs, using the “GCP/MTP Manager” after the first
processing step (“Initial Processing”) has been completed. Make sure the
GCPs and the project have the same coordinate system.</p></li>
<li><p>After loading the GCP points, they will appear as “pins” in your
point cloud, visible in the rayCloud viewer.</p></li>
<li><p>Manually match photos with the GCPs in which they are visible
using the rayCloud editor. Refer to the <a href="https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000276046-How-to-import-and-mark-ground-control-points-GCPs-PIX4Dmapper" class="external-link">PIX4D
documentation</a> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue by “Reoptimize” your project, under the “Process”
drop-down menu and continue with the second and third processing
steps.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a DJI drone, we may encounter issues when importing the
GCP coordinates from their .csv-file. If that is the case,
<em>first</em> manually create tie points where the GCPs are marked the
GCPs in multiple photos (with identical names to their labels in the
.csv-file) and <em>then</em> import the coordinates using the “GCP/MTP
Manager”. Finish by clicking “Rematch and Optimize”, under the “Process”
drop down menu.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
<p>PIX4D will automatically create sub folders for each processing step
of your project, contained in its main folder that you specified the
directory for when loading in photos. The final thermal orthomosaic
image will be found under the project’s subfolder named “3_dsm_ortho”
and from there in “2_mosaic”. There should be two .tif-files in the
folder. Extract the one that is <strong>not</strong> the visual
orthomosaic (i.e. non-black-and-white image) and export it to the
directory where it can be used in subsequent processing steps within the
<code>R</code> workflow of <code>throne</code>.</p>
